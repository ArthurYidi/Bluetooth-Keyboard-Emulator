Swift Bluetooth HID Keyboard Emulator

> Open sourced from the [Keyboard Connect](http://arthuryidi.com/projects/keyboard-connect/) project. The following sample shows how to publish a HID Bluetooth keyboard service.

## How to Use

- Run the Xcode project

From your phone/tablet:

- Go to Bluetooth settings
- If already paired with desktop, then "Forget the Device"
- Connect to your dekstop.
- Start Typing!

## Source Files

- **BTKeyboard.swift**

  Creates a Bluetooth SDP service using **SerialPortDictionary.plist** and listens for incoming connections.

- **KeyCodes.swift**

  Converts virtual key codes (the number assigned to keys according NSEvent) to HID key codes (as specified in the USB specification).

- **AppDelegate.swift**

  Initializes BTKeyboard then uses CGEventTap to get keyboard events and send them to the connected Bluetooth device.

- **SerialPortDictionary.plist**

  A service record with a Human Interface Device Profile (HID). The HID profile describes a keyboard and the report used is outlined in **HIDReportDescriptor.txt**

- **HIDReportDescriptor.txt**

  The parsed HIDReportDescriptor outlines how the bytes are described for a generic keyboard.
